    <h1>SAT Competition 2020</h1>
	<h2>Description of Tracks</h2>
	The following tracks will be featured in 2020 SAT Competition.
	<ol>
	<li>
		<b>Main Track</b> is the track of sequential SAT solvers. We will use 300-600 benchmark problems, the time limit will be 5000 seconds.
		All solvers participating in the Main track are required to provide certificates in both SAT and UNSAT cases. 
		For more information about the UNSAT certificates see <a href="certificates.html">this page</a>.<br/>
		We encourage <b>Glucose hack</b> authors to participate in the main track. 
		A prize will be awarded to the best	Glucose hack (based on Glucose 3.0). 
		For more detals plase see <a href="hack.html">this page</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Planning Track</b> is the track of SAT solvers good on SAT instances which encode AI planning problems.
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Cloud Track (16 cores)</b>
	</li>
	<li>
		<b>Cloud Track (1024 cores)</b>
	</li>
	<!--<li>
		<b>No-Limits Track</b> is a special track where solver source code and solution certificates are not required and portfolios of any nature are allowed. Only brand new benchmarks will be used
	in this track.
	</li>-->
	<li>
		<b>Incremental Library Track</b> is for incremental SAT solvers, click <a href="incremental.html">here for more details</a>.
	</li>
	</ol>
	
	<p>
		Printing a model in case of a satisfiable instance is required for all tracks expect for "no-limits". 
		UNSAT certificates (proofs) are required only in the main tracks.
	</p>
	
	<h2>Execution Environment</h2>
	<p>
		All the tracks except for the Cloud Track and Incremental Library Track will be run on the <a href="https://www.starexec.org/starexec/public/about.jsp">StarExec cluster</a>.
		The time limit for solving an instance will be 5000 seconds (in each track). 
		The solvers will be allowed to use up to 24GB of RAM
	</p>

	<!--<p>The Parallel Track will be run on computers with Dual Socket
	Xeon E5-2690 v3 (Haswell) : 12 cores per socket (24 cores/node), 2.6 GHz processors and
	64 GB DDR4-2133 (8 x 8GB dual rank x8 DIMMS) main memory.
	Hyperthreading is Enabled - 48 threads (logical CPUs) per node.

	Compute nodes lack a local disk, but users have access to a 32 GB /tmp
	RAM disk to accelerate IO operations. Note that any space taken in
	/tmp will decrease the total amount of memory available on the node.
	If 8 GB of data are written to /tmp the maximum memory available for
	applications and OS on the node will then be 64 GB - 8 GB = 56GB.
	</p>-->

	<!--<p>
	The Incremental Library Track will be run on computers with 2 x Intel Xeon X5355 2.66 GHz (4-Core) processors and 24GB of RAM.
	</p>-->
	
	<h2>Awards</h2>
	<p>In total we will distribute 19 prizes. One prize for the best Glucose hack and
	3 prizes for each of the Main, Parallel, Agile, Random SAT, Incremental Library and No-Limits Tracks:</p>
	<ul>
	<li>1st prize (solved the highest number of instances)</li>
	<li>2nd prize </li>
	<li>3rd prize </li>
	</ul>
