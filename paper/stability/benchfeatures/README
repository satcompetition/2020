Contained files:
  main.csv : results of the main track of the SAT competition 2018

  benchmark_families.csv: the list of problem instances and their family
  extracted from the folder name of the submitted problems.
 
  python scripts:
  					par2_generator.py,
            random_sampling_plots.py,
            family_and_SAT_random_sampling_plots.py
            
  run_all.sh: Executes all python scripts.

The contained python scripts extract the used information from the competition
results and generate the plots used in our submission to POS'19.
The output plots of the scripts are saved into sub-folder 'plots/'.

1. Extract from competition results (main.csv) PAR2 scores (par2scores.csv) and
   satisfiability answers (instance_answers.csv):

  ./par2_generator.py

2. Generate random sampling plots of results (Figure 2, 7 and 8):

  ./random_sampling_plots.py

3. Generate family and satisfiability based random sampling plots
   (Figure 3, 4, 5 and 6):

  ./family_and_SAT_random_sampling_plots.py

Or to do all the above in one step:
  ./run_all.sh
