\begin{abstract}
SAT Competition 2020 stands in the tradition of the series of annual competitive events which motivate and assess the progress in SAT solving. 
This competition was special as it introduced the new cloud track where SAT Solvers that run on hundreds of processors can compete. 
Another novelty is the application-specific sub-track of the main track, where solvers compete in solving benchmark instances from one specific domain only, and in this year that was the planning domain. 
We use new tools to select and distribute benchmark instances and their attributes. 
In this paper we provide a description of the well-known and the new competition tracks and how we organized them. 
It follows then a detailed analysis of the results and the strategies of the award winning solvers.

\section{Introduction}

Propositional satisfiability (SAT) is the archetypal NP-complete problem. 
Despite its complexity, there is ongoing progress in solving methods and their implementations in SAT solvers. 
The generic nature of the SAT problem as well as the performance of state-of-the-art SAT solvers facilitate their use as the algorithmic backend in a plethora of applications. 
Today, SAT solvers are used for verification of hard- and software, product configuration, cryptography, planning and scheduling, to name a few. 
In mathematics, SAT solvers were recently even used to generate a record sized proof (200 TB) for an until then unsolved problem in Ramsey theory. 

SAT Competitions are organized regularly since 1992 in order to drive progress and to serve as a public assessment of the state-of-the-art in SAT solving. 
For each SAT Competition, a set of new benchmark instances is compiled which reflects the various applications of interest to the community. 

In this competition, we initiated a new application-specific subtrack. 
The idea is to provide a large amount of benchmark instances of a specific application, and to evaluate all solvers with respect to these instance in a special track. 
In this competition, we used 200 instances of the planning domain to run a planning subtrack. 

Faster networks, distributed systems, and the increasing number of processors in modern computers show that the trend of increasing parallelism is about to continue.  
In the new cloud track, for the first time, solver authors could compete in SAT technologies that allow hundreds of SAT solvers to cooperate in solving a SAT instance. 

\todo{Present some important pointers for SAT and CDCL}

In Section~\ref{sec:tracks}, we start with a detailed description of the competition tracks and their purpose. 
Section~\ref{sec:instances} contains an overview on the selected benchmark instances and details about the selection process. 
In Section~\ref{sec:results}, we present the competition results alongside a survey on the winning strategies of the award winning solvers. 
A meta-analysis of these results follows in Section~\ref{sec:analysis}, and we conclude with Section~\ref{sec:conclusion}.

\section{Description of Benchmark Instances}
\label{sec:instances}

For selection of benchmark instances in this competition, we used GBD Tools\footnote{\url{https://pypi.org/project/gbd-tools/}}. 
GBD Tools is a tool-chain for maintenance and distribuation of benchmark instances and instances features~\cite{Iser:2018:GBD}. 
Its database\footnote{\url{https://gbd.iti.kit.edu}} contains information about all instances used in SAT competitive events dating back to 2006. 
In GBD Server, each instance also has an URL, such that instances can also be distributed by using their identifier: \url{https://gbd.iti.kit.edu/file/<gbd-hash>}.

Using the concept of instance identification via GBD Hash, which is the hash-sum of the unpacked and normalized DIMACS file, GBD Tools provide utilities to query for instances with specific properties, while maintaining the association of instance-id and instance attributes in publicly available databases.
Like this it is possible to query for instances with desired properties, e.g., instance author, family and result, which gives the instance selection process a new quality. 


\subsection{Selection of Instances}

The ``Bring Your Own Benchmarks'' (BYOB) rule (applied as of SAT Competition 2017~\cite{SC2017}) requires solver authors to submit $20$ new benchmark instances in order to participate in the competition. At least $10$ of these instances are required to be ``interesting'', whereby interesting is defined as Minisat~\cite{Niklas:2003:Minisat} needs at least one minute to solve it and the authors own solver does not run into a timeout for the instance. 

In total, $28$ authors followed our calls for participation and benchmark instances, thus contributing to a set of $1260$ previously unseen benchmark instances with a variety of $27$ different instance families. 
By filtering out instances with could be solved by Minisat in less than $10$ minutes, we obtained an initial set of $1012$ instances. 

In order to compile a balanced set of $300$ benchmark instances, we used the procedure which is depicted in Algorithm~\ref{algo:select} to select a maximium of $14$ submissions per author. 
Per author, if possible, we first randomly selected $7$ satisfiable and $7$ unsatisfiable instances (lines~3 and~4). 
If this did not yield a total of $14$ instances, we added instances of yet unknown outcome (lines~5-7). 
Of the such obtained $308$ instances, we randomly removed $8$ satisfiable instances, yielding a total of $114$ satisfiable, $78$ unsatisfiable and $108$ instances of unknown result. 

\begin{algorithm}[t]
\DontPrintSemicolon

\KwData{$I$ : Set of Instances, $A$ : Set of Authors}
\KwData{Functions $\alpha : I \rightarrow A$ and $\sigma : I \rightarrow \{\mathsf{sat}, \mathsf{unsat}, \mathsf{unknown}\}$}
\KwResult{$S$ : Set of Selected Instances}
\SetKwFunction{rand}{$\mathsf{random.choice}$}
\BlankLine
$S \leftarrow \emptyset$\;

\For {$a \in A$} {
	$I_a^+ \leftarrow$ \rand{$\{ e \in I \mid \alpha(e) = a \land \sigma(e) = \mathsf{sat} \}$, $k=7$}\;	
	$I_a^- \leftarrow$ \rand{$\{ e \in I \mid \alpha(e) = a \land \sigma(e) = \mathsf{unsat} \}$, $k=7$}\;	
	\If {$|I_a^+|+|I_a^-| < 14$}{
		$l \leftarrow 14 - (|I_a^+|+|I_a^-|)$\;
		$I_a^? \leftarrow$ \rand{$\{ e \in I \mid \alpha(e) = a \land \sigma(e) = \mathsf{unknown} \}$, $k=l$}\;
	}
	$S \leftarrow S \cup I_a^+ \cup I_a^- \cup I_a^?$\;	
}
\Return $S$\;

\caption{Benchmark Instance Selection}
\label{algo:select}
\end{algorithm}

To obtain the final compilation of $400$ benchmark instances, we augmented this set with $100$ instances which have been used in previous competitions. 
We randomly selected $21$ satisfiable, $57$ unsatisfiable and $22$ unknown instances to yield a total of $135$ satisfiable, $135$ unsatisfiable and $130$ instances of unkown result. 
Furthermore, we made sure not to select instances of a family which is already represented in the set of newly submitted instances and excluded random, agile and planning instances (due to the planning track).

\section{Competition Results}
\label{sec:results}
\todo{for each track summarize the descriptions of the winning solvers}

\subsection{Main Track}

\subsubsection{Kissat} 

If it came to determine an overall winner of all the subtracks in the Main Track of this competition, then it would clearly be Kissat. 
Kissat was submitted in three configurations, including one default configuration and specialized configurations specifically tailored towards satisfiable or unsatisfiable instances, respectively.
Kissat won four awards, by achieving first place in the overall Main Track, first place in its Unsat Sub-Track, second place in the Sat Sub-Track and third place in the Planning Sub-Track. 

Kissat is a reimplementation of Cadical~\cite{} in C, thus, taking advantage of finegrained control on the memory layout of new sophisticated data-structures used to manage watchers and clauses, e.g., through binary clause inlining, sentinel values and bit stuffing~\cite{}. 

In Kissat forward subsumption for learned clauses was entirely replaced by more powerful vivification algorithms~\cite{}. 
For irredundant clauses forward subsumption is still executed together with variable eliminiation during pre- and inprocessing, but only in a very focused way, by carefully monitoring variable occurences~\cite{}.

Kissat also comes with a refined scheduling of inprocessing procedures based on growing conflict intervals. 
Regarding the duration of alternating restart modes, the Kissat authors considered conflict-rate being too unstable, and come up with ``ticks'', which is a new method to measure the length of two alternating restart-modes based on the approximate number of cache-line accesses. 

Considering target phases~\cite{}, Kissat authors come up with an innovative use-case for autarkies to account for saved phases. 
Before each rephasing step they compute the largest autarky of the full assignment with an algorithm described in~\cite{}. 
The authors claim this autarky contains satisfying assignments of disconnected components which otherwise would get lost, and thus next, they are considered in variable elimination. 


\subsubsection{CryptoMiniSat-CCAnr}

This solver won three awards, two third places in the Main Track and its Sat Subtrack, and one second place in the Planning Subtrack. 
It was submitted in two variants, with and without LSIDS~\cite{}, which is a phase selection heuristic similar to VSIDS and if active it is used only when backtracking is chronological. 
The version with LSIDS overall performed slightly better.

By tight integration of CCAnr, a stochastic local search (SLS) solver, into CryptoMinisat, CryptoMiniSat-CCAnr combines the two SAT solving strategies SLS and CDCL in a unique way. 
As in CaDiCal, they run local search for a short period of time in regular intervals and (just in case SLS finds no solution) change the polarities according to the best assignment found by the SLS solver~\cite{}.
In addition to this technique known as ``rephasing'' from CaDiCal, they bump VSIDS scores of the first 100 variables contained in the clauses which the SLS solver considers most hard to satisfy. 

This version of CryptoMiniSat comes with an highly optimized implementation of Gauss-Jordan Elimination. 
CryptoMiniSat includes BreakId, a sub-system that calculates symmetry breaking clauses, which it calls on every 5th inprocessing iteration.

CryptoMiniSat changes decay factors of VSIDS and Maple heuristics dynamically after each inprocessing step to avoid sticking to a single best configuration.
As in CaDiCal (and now Kissat) CryptoMiniSat is switching between Polarity Caching and Stable Phases. \todo{It is not clear if this is also the case when LSIDS is activated.}
Inprocessing now also include ternary resolution. 


\subsubsection{Cadical Hacks: Trail and AllUip}

This modified version of last years CaDiCal was submitted with the two new methods ``trail'' and ``alluip''. 
It was submitted in three configurations, one with both methods activated and two other with each having only one of them active. 
These hacks got two awards, second price in the Unsat Sub-Track of the Main Track and first price in the Planning Track.
