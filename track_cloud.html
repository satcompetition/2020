	<h2>Cloud Track</h2>

A new track in SAT Competition 2020 is the Cloud Track, which will evaluate the effectiveness of
parallel SAT solvers to run in a distributed manner. This track will be run on Amazon Web Services.
The solvers participating in this track will be executed with a wall-clock time limit of 1000 seconds running 
on 100 machines in parallel. Communication between the machines is possible using MPI and SSH. 
Details regarding the machine specifications used in this track, including the number of
cores and the amount of memory, will be made available soon.<BR><BR>

Similar to the Parallel Track, participants of this track are required to submit their solver 
via a GitHub repository (which can be private). The repository should contain a docker file
that compiles the solver. Examples repositories of distributed parallel solvers will be provided soon.
