    <h1>SAT Competition 2020</h1>
	<h2>Planning Track</h2>
	  <p>The Planning Track is just like Main Track except for it has 200 benchmarks, which all come from
	  the same application domain - automated planning.</p>
	  <p>The benchmarks will be in the standard DIMACS format (like in all the other tracks). We will select
	  100 satisfiable and 100 unsatisfiable formulas of various size and difficulty. All the formulas
	  will encode either classical or HTN (Hierarchical Task Network) planning  problem instances using
	  several of the available encoding schemas.</p>
	  <p>If you wish to participate in the Planning Track you only need to regitster to the Main or Glucose-Hack Track, since
	  all the participants of the those tracks are automatically included.</p>
