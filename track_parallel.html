	<h2>Parallel Track</h2>

The Parallel Track will be run on Amazon Web Services. The solvers participating in this track
will be executed with a wall-clock time limit of 5000 seconds, thus similar to the Main Track.
Details regarding the machine specifications used in this track, including the number of cores and the amount 
of memory, will be made available soon.<BR><BR>

Similar to the Cloud Track, participants of this track are required to submit their solver 
via a GitHub repository (which can be private). The repository should contain a docker file
that compiles the solver. Examples repositories of parallel solvers will be provided soon.
